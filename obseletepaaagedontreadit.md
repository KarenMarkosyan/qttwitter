**Well There is no point in code/effort duplication , already open source world is plagued with it , so in that spirit i would like to say any effective development from my side on Qttwitter will stop immediately as i found out a much mature , good looking Twitter client written in qt :P

i would contact it's author and  i guess would try coaxing him to let me help him in his project :)
it was fun working with you all, and yes this project will remain here , i am not planning to remove it anytime in future.
btw in case you are wondering this client is in WORKING STATE , so you can still DOWNLOAD AND USE IT :)**
